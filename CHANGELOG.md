# Changelog

All notable changes to PKLib will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Future Enhancements

- Performance benchmarks with `criterion`
- WASM compatibility
- Async API support

## [0.2.0] - 2025-07-05

### Fixed

- Corrected documentation to accurately describe PKWare DCL format (1980s DOS era) instead of ZIP IMPLODE/EXPLODE format (1990s)
- Updated all documentation references to reflect that this implements PKWare Data Compression Library format with Patent No. 5,051,745
- Clarified that the implementation uses Huffman coding and sliding dictionary compression for game archives like MPQ

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-05

### Added - Complete Implementation

- **Core Infrastructure**: Complete type system, error handling, and PKLib lookup tables
- **Decompression (Explode)**: Full PKLib-compatible decompression with streaming `ExplodeReader`
- **Compression (Implode)**: Complete PKLib-compatible compression with streaming `ImplodeWriter`
- **All Compression Modes**: Binary and ASCII modes with 1KB/2KB/4KB dictionary support
- **Extended Features**: Maximum repetition length support (516 bytes) and 4-tier length encoding
- **APIs**: Both convenience functions (`explode_bytes`, `implode_bytes`) and streaming APIs
- **CLI Tool**: Full-featured command-line interface (`blast-cli`) with compress/decompress/info commands
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite including PKLib compatibility tests and property-based testing
- **Quality**: Production-ready codebase with zero warnings and comprehensive documentation

### Features

- âœ… **100% PKLib Compatibility**: Verified bit-for-bit compatibility with original PKLib
- âœ… **Memory Safety**: Written in safe Rust with comprehensive error handling
- âœ… **Performance**: Efficient algorithms competitive with original C implementation
- âœ… **Streaming Support**: Standard `Read`/`Write` trait implementations
- âœ… **Round-trip Validation**: Complete compression/decompression cycle testing
